‚úÖ AWS Syllabus for DevOps Beginners (2025 Edition)
Here‚Äôs a step-by-step learning path:

üü¢ Phase 1: AWS Fundamentals (Cloud Basics)
Learn the core building blocks of AWS

Topics	Purpose
What is Cloud Computing?	Basics of IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
AWS Global Infrastructure	Region, Availability Zone, Edge Location
AWS Free Tier Setup	Practice account creation and billing alert setup

üîµ Phase 2: Core AWS Services
These are must-know for every DevOps engineer.

‚úÖ Compute
EC2 (Launch, SSH access, key pairs, AMI, security groups)

Auto Scaling (launch config, policies)

Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)

‚úÖ Storage
S3 (buckets, versioning, lifecycle rules, static hosting)

EBS (volume types, snapshots)

EFS (shared storage across EC2)

‚úÖ Networking
VPC (subnets, route tables, NAT, IGW)

Security Groups vs NACLs

Elastic IPs, Public vs Private IP

Route 53 (DNS basics, record types)

‚úÖ Databases
RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL)

DynamoDB (NoSQL basics)

üü£ Phase 3: DevOps & Automation Tools on AWS
These help you automate deployments, infrastructure, and CI/CD.

‚úÖ Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
CloudFormation (templates, stacks)

Terraform (often used instead of CloudFormation)

‚úÖ CI/CD
CodeCommit (Git repo)

CodeBuild (build server)

CodePipeline (CI/CD pipeline)

CodeDeploy (deployment to EC2/ASG)

‚úÖ Containers & Serverless
ECS / Fargate (for running containers)

Lambda (serverless functions)

API Gateway (for exposing Lambdas)

üü† Phase 4: Monitoring & Security
These are key in real-world operations and troubleshooting.

‚úÖ Monitoring
CloudWatch (logs, metrics, dashboards, alarms)

CloudTrail (audit AWS API calls)

‚úÖ IAM (Identity & Access Management)
Users, groups, policies, roles

MFA, least privilege, trust relationships

üí° Real-World DevOps Use Cases on AWS
Auto-deploy app using CodePipeline ‚Üí CodeBuild ‚Üí ECS

Monitor EC2 memory/disk with CloudWatch Agent

Spin up infra with Terraform or CloudFormation

Store logs/backups in S3 with lifecycle rules

üß† AWS DevOps Interview Topics (Beginner to Mid-Level)
Area	Questions
EC2	How to launch EC2, troubleshoot SSH, set up auto-scaling
S3	Public access, versioning, bucket policy, static hosting
IAM	Difference between user, role, group; inline vs managed policy
VPC	Private/public subnet setup, NAT vs IGW
CI/CD	Explain CodePipeline workflow, integrating with GitHub
CloudWatch	Create alarm for high CPU, log insights
Lambda	Real use case, cold start, timeout issues
ECS vs EKS	Basic comparison, when to use which
Terraform vs CloudFormation	Syntax, lifecycle, use-case difference
